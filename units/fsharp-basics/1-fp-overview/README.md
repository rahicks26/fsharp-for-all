# Functional Programming Overview

We are going to start our journey of understanding F# by first understanding some basic ideas in functional programming. Don't worry if a few of these don't seem super important or if you don't quite understand them. We will come back to each of them after we have a basic understanding. When you are ready to jump in here is what we have for this lesson:

- Read `fp-overview`
- Solve each exercise in `fp-overview.exercises`
- Review & Reflect on `fp-overview.solutions`

As always questions and comments are welcome in the discussion.
