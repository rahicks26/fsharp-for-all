# Functional Programming Concepts

We are going to start our journey of understanding F# by first understanding some basic ideas in functional programming. Don't worry if a few of these don't seem super important or if you don't quite understand them. We will come back to each of them after we have a basic understanding.

## Basics of Functional Programming
It is always hard to distill what something is really all about, but that is exactly what we will do in today's exercises. You will be working though some basic examples to understand:

- Immutability
- Functions as first class citizens
- Declarative 

There is much more functional programming then this, but these basic ideas guide us and help us to right simple code that is easy to test.

## Next Steps
When you are ready to jump in here is what we have for this lesson:

- Read `fp-overview`
- Solve each exercise in `fp-overview.exercises`
- Review & Reflect on `fp-overview.solutions`

As always questions and comments are welcome in the discussion.
